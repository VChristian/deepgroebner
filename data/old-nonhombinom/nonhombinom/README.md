# Trained models for nonhomogeneous binomial Buchberger

Models were trained with the script `script.py` in this directory using commit b614914.
Hyperparameters are in the script. Training was performed on an AWS p2.xlarge running the
Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 21.2 - ami-0a47106e391391252 and using the tensorflow_p36
environment. Average rewards over each epoch of training are in `rewards.txt` in this
directory. Total training time was roughly 5 days.
